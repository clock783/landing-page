Odin Project - Landing Page Project

Project Objective - To practice the basic HTML and CSS I have learned by creating a landing page.
Final project will look like this ![Odin Sample](01.png)

Other Notes / Comments:
- I mainly used flexbox model to style the page. I have a tendency to nest classes where I don't need to so I tried to be aware of that. In other words, if the element does not need to be a flex item / container, then it isn't. (e.g. the footer of the page)
- Beyond git commits, I'm not quite sure how to properly comment my html / css files. Perhaps its due to the simplicity of the assignment. Need to improve this in  future exercises.
